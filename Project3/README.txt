My Custom Malloc 
Project 3 Notes

Compilation:

mallocdrv: gcc -g mymalloc.c mallocdrv.c -o mallocdrv
	   ./mallocdrv

mymalloc_test: gcc -g mymalloc.c mymalloc_test.c -o mymalloc_test
	       ./mymalloc_test

"mymalloc.c" compiles without any problems. 

Both "mymalloc_test" and "mallocdrv" work without any problems. 

All files work without any issues at compilation. 

I made comments throughout "mymalloc.c" where I thought was necessary to help understand what the program is doing.
